\noindent
I want to thank my advisor, Dr. Martin Schreiber, for giving me helpful pointers whenever I thought I was at a dead end.
I also want to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Schulz, for allowing me to pursue this subject, even though it is only tangentially related to his main area of research.\\
Finally, I want to thank my family and friends who have always supported me throughout my studies.
