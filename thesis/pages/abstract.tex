Weather and climate models based on the Navier Stokes Equations often employ the hydrostatic assumption whereby one assumes the atmosphere to be in vertical equilibrium between gravity and vertical air pressure.
As this assumption affects the simulated physical effects, in this thesis, we relax the hydrostatic assumption, and specifically study the vertical dimension.
To this end, we present a tested, modular and flexible prototyping implementation in Python 3 which provides complete access to integration methods and discretization.
%We then validate the implementation using a suite of test cases.
